Kinematic Analysis of ARISTO Robot using RoboAnalyzer

This repository corresponds to my article **[Kinematic Analysis of ARISTO Robot using RoboAnalyzer](https://medium.com/@manojreddy2404/kinematic-analysis-of-aristo-robot-using-roboanalyzer-a7d5f33a9742)**.  
It contains resources and simulation data to explore the ARISTO robotâ€™s kinematics using the RoboAnalyzer tool.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Introduces the **ARISTO Robot**: its structure, degrees of freedom, joints, and real-world relevance.  
- Performs **forward kinematics** with sample inputs to compute end-effector positions.  
- Carries out **inverse kinematics** to determine joint configurations for given poses.  
- Simulates joint trajectories and generates plots for angles, velocities, accelerations.  
- Compares kinematic performance under different configurations or constraints.  
- Aimed as a learning tool for robotics students, educators, and hobbyists.
